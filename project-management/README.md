#### Nice to Have

User stories considered nice-to-have means that they are **not** included in the initial scope of the project.

### Work Breakdown Structure

![image](./wbs.png)

### Working with user stories

#### User Stories Life-Cycle

1. Generally a story is written by the product owner, product manager, or program manager and submitted for review.
2. During a sprint or iteration planning meeting, the team decides what stories they‚Äôll tackle that sprint.
3. Teams now discuss the requirements and functionality that each user story requires. This is an opportunity to get technical and creative in the team‚Äôs implementation of the story.
4. Once agreed upon, these requirements are added to the story.
5. Another common step in this meeting is to score the stories based on their complexity or time to completion. Teams use t-shirt sizes, the Fibonacci sequence, or planning poker to make proper estimations. **A story should be sized to complete in one sprint**, so as the team specs each story, they make sure to break up stories that will go over that completion horizon.  

#### How to write user stories

Consider the following when writing user stories:

- Definition of ‚Äúdone‚Äù ‚Äî The story is generally ‚Äúdone‚Äù when the user can complete the outlined task, but make sure to define what that is.
- Outline subtasks or tasks ‚Äî Decide which specific steps need to be completed and who is responsible for each of them.
- User personas ‚Äî For whom? If there are multiple end users, consider making multiple stories.
- Ordered Steps ‚Äî Write a story for each step in a larger process.
- Listen to feedback ‚Äî Talk to your users and capture the problem or need in their words. No need to guess at stories when you can source them from your customers.  
- Time ‚Äî Time is a touchy subject. Many development teams avoid discussions of time altogether, relying instead on their estimation frameworks. Since stories should be completable in one sprint, stories that might take weeks or months to complete should be broken up into smaller stories or should be considered their own epic.

#### User story template and examples

Pattern: **"As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]"** (Persona + need + purpose)

- **"As a [persona]"**: Who are we building this for? We‚Äôre not just after a job title, we‚Äôre after the persona of the person. Max. Our team should have a shared understanding of who Max is. We‚Äôve hopefully interviewed plenty of Max‚Äôs. We understand how that person works, how they think and what they feel. We have empathy for Max.
- **‚ÄúWants to‚Äù**: Here we‚Äôre describing their intent ‚Äî not the features they use. What is it they‚Äôre actually trying to achieve? This statement should be implementation free ‚Äî if you‚Äôre describing any part of the UI and not what the user goal is you're missing the point.
- **‚ÄúSo that‚Äù**: how does their immediate desire to do something this fit into their bigger picture? What‚Äôs the overall benefit they‚Äôre trying to achieve? What is the big problem that needs solving?
