### About

- **Project Name**: Metalhead Robot
- **Project Justification**: This project born from the lack of interest of the metalheads in the new metal bands, listening only the classic old bands. So, we want to create a robot that will recommend new releases based mainly on the release date. Many bands are out there doing a great job. We want to help them to be heard. We also don't want to hear "Heavy Metal is dying" anymore.
- **Project Objective**: Create a web application that will recommend new albums based on the release date, genre, country, type and other user's preferences.
